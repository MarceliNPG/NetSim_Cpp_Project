This group project was part of Advanced Object Oriented Programming course at AGH UST.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to design system which can be used for modeling and simulating industrial network. As example we used industrial production line.
To create that system, we used C++ language with object-oriented programming. Completing this task had to consolidate our knowlege about that language and OOP principles.
